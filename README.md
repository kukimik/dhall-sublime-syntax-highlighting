# Dhall Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

Syntax definition for the [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/) configuration language in the [.sublime-syntax](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html) format, which is used among others by the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor and the [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) Rust library.

## Can this be installed using Package Contol?

Not yet. But it is going to replace the [Dhall package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dhall), which is no longer available.

## Authorship and licensing

The original Dhall syntax highlighting package for Sublime Text was authored by Lawrence Bell. In 2020 the package was removed from github. Fortunately a copy of the `.sublime-syntax` file was preserved by one of the users. Under the original author's permission the file was
republished in 2025 under the MIT license.
