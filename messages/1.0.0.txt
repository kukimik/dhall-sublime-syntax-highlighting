The Dhall syntax highlighting package has been re-released after approximately 5 years. In 2020 the original package, authored by Lawrence Bell, was removed from GitHub. Fortunately a copy of the `.sublime-syntax` file was preserved by one of the users. Under the original author's permission the file was republished in 2025 under the MIT license and is now maintained by Michał Kukieła.

If you happen to have a copy the original package in its entirety, please contact the new maintainer via a github issue (currently I only have the original .sublime-syntax file, and I am not even sure if it is the latest published version).

Compared to the 0.1.0 version the present 1.0.0 version:

* removes the `Dhall: Format (Pretty Print) Dhall` command (I don't have the original code for this, and anyway this should rather be done via LSP);
* adds syntax highlighting for:

  + built-in functions, types and constants:
    - Natural/subtract,
    - Integer/{negate,clamp},
    - Text/{show,replace},
    - Date/show,
    - Time/show,
    - TimeZone/show,
    - Date,
    - Time,
    - TimeZone,
    - Bytes,
    - Sort,
    - None,
    - Some,
    - Infinity,
    - NaN,
  + keywords:
    - toMap,
    - with,
    - showConstructor,
    - assert,
  + operators:
    - ≡ and ===,
  + Bytes literals,
  + 'as Bytes' and 'as Location' modes in imports.

* has a new test suite (the old one is missing, but it was partially reconstructed from https://github.com/dhall-lang/vscode-language-dhall)
* an alternative syntax highlighting definition converted from the VSCode Dhall plugin
