The Dhall syntax highlighting package has been re-released after approximately 5 years. In 2020 the original package, authored by Lawrence Bell, was removed from GitHub. Fortunately a copy of the .sublime-syntax file was preserved by one of the users. Under the original author's permission the file has been republished in 2025 under the MIT license and the package is now maintained by Michał Kukieła.

If you happen to have a copy the original package in its entirety, please contact the new maintainer via a GitHub issue (https://github.com/kukimik/dhall-sublime-syntax-highlighting/issues).

Compared to the 0.1.0 version, the present 0.2.0 version most notably:

- removes the `Dhall: Format (Pretty Print) Dhall` command (I don't have the original code for this, please check the [Fmt](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Fmt) plugin for an alternative solution);
- adds support for a few recent additions to the language (a number of keywords, built-in types and functions, the equivalence operator, hexadecimal and binary integer and natural literals);
- contains an alternative syntax highlighting definition converted from the VS Code Dhall plugin;
- includes a Comments.tmPreferences file used by the 'Toggle Comment' and 'Toggle Block Comment' commands (such a file might have been available in the 0.1.0 version, but I am not aware of it and it has been created from scratch).

Please consult the CHANGELOG (https://github.com/kukimik/dhall-sublime-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a more detailed list of changes.
